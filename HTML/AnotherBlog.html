    <p>Ever wanted to learn to change the oil on your car? I'd recommend looking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1hF25Cowv8">here.</a> But if you're not going to heed that timely warning, read on, friend.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="instructions">
    <h3>Here are your instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Get the front of your car off the ground. Use a jack, jack stands, be safe. You're going to be underneath your car. If it teams up with gravity against you, you're going to lose.</li>
      <li>Look under the car and find the oil drain plug. You're looking for a bolt pointing at the ground on a slant, attached to a flat area, like <a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41KMd%2B1RoyL._SX466_.jpg" target="_blank">this.</a></li>
      <li>Put a drain pan under that bolt, then remove the bolt. This will be messy.</li>
      <li>Once the old oil is gone, put the drainage bolt back and change the oil filter:
        <ol id="filterinstructions">
        <li>Unscrew the old filter. Could be tough, may need an oil filter wrench.</li>
        <li>Dump the old oil out of the filter.</li>
        <li>Put a little oil on the gasket of the new filter and screw it on hand-tight.</li>
      </ol></li>
      <li>Now pour in new oil. Make sure it's the right kind (see table below) and the right amount. Check your owner's manual for this info.</li>
      <li>Dispose of the old oil properly. Municipal recycling facilities are a good bet, or your local auto parts store.</li>
    </ol>
